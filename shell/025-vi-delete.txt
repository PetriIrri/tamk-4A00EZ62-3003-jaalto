How to copy and paste in vi:
A. Delete the duplicate line added in previous exercise.
In command mode inputting <dd> will delete the line

B: Change sentences of remaining line to read as follows:

If saved, all worked ok. This is test file for vi-editor.

You can enter replace mode by inputting <R> and then write on line the replacement.
Another way is by using <D$> which deletes from cursor to the end of file.
<shift + D>  is the same as <D$>.
Then you can paste the deleted text with <p>

#end of file
