How to use search and replace.

Example code:

str firstName = "Kalalampi";
system.out.printLn(firstName);
firstName = "Kuhalampi";
system.out.printLn(firstName);

end of example.

To search and replace all instances of variable firstName we can use M-x and type replace-string.
It is important that the cursor is at the start of the file if you want to search the whole file.
Then emacs asks what we want to replace. In this case it is firstName.
After that it asks what we want to replace it with. In this case lastName is a good option.
After this every instance below the cursor position is replaced with the given text.
