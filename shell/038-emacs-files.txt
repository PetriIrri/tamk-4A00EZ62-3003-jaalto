A: open two files
You can open another file into the buffer with C-x C-f.
To switch between buffers use C-x b. By default it takes you back to previously visited
buffer or you can type the name of the buffer.
C-x C-b gives you a list of buffers. 

B: Display both files in window view
first open another file into buffer.
Split the window in half with C-x 2.
move to the another window with C-x o.
use C-x b to open the file from buffer.

C: Edit both files in turn
You can move between the files with C-x o.
You can use this to switch between the files and edit whichever you want.

D: Copy a line from one buffer to another
First select the region you want to copy with C-SPC.
Then copy the selected region with M-w.
Switch the window with C-x o.
And finally use C-y to paste the text.

E: Save both files
You can save all files in buffer with C-x s.
Emacs prompts for answer for each of the files to be saved.

# END of file
